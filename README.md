# 🚧 Sewage Worker Safety IoT Project 🌐

## Overview

This project focuses on enhancing the safety of sewage workers by implementing an IoT solution that monitors environmental gases within sewage tunnels and tracks workers' heartbeats in real-time.
The system utilizes a network of intelligent sensors and a wearable device, providing comprehensive data for prompt hazard detection and intervention.

## Features

- 🌍 **Environmental Monitoring:** Intelligent sensors measure gases like methane and hydrogen sulfide in sewage tunnels.
- 💓 **Real-time Heartbeat Tracking:** Wearable devices continuously monitor workers' heartbeats.
- 📊 **Webpage Interface:** User-friendly dashboard displays real-time gas levels and worker heartbeat data.
- ⚠️ **Immediate Alerts:** The system generates alerts for potential hazards, enabling quick responses to emergencies.

## Boards and Sensors Used
- NodeMCU ESP32
- NodeMCU ESP8266
- MQ4 Methane Sensor
- MQ35 Airquality Sensor
- Ultrasonic Sensor
- DHT11 Temperature Sensor

## Languages Used
- PHP
- HTML CSS JS
- C++
- SQL

## Operations Of This Project
- There are two kits involved in this project, a drainage kit and a worker kit
- Drainage kit involves gas sensors and ultrasonic sensor
- Worker kit involves heartbeat sensor
- The Microcontrollers detect the datas from the sesor
- The datas are collected in realtime and are visulaized in our webpage using HTTP Protocol
- Immediate alerts are given at time of Dangerous Situations

## Requirements to Run this Project
- Give appropriate connections to the sensors on the board
- Specify your wifi name and pswd in the arduino program and specify the webhost link
- For easy use create a host link using 000webhost.com
- Upload the webpage program and sql querie after createing a DB
- You are good to Go :)
